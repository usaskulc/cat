The open source Curriculum Alignment Tool (CAT) is one approach for collecting data about your program, courses and inventorying their instructional methods, assessments, and contributions to program learning outcomes.  If you are interested in using CAT, please contact Brad Wuetherick at brad.wuetherick@usask.ca.
